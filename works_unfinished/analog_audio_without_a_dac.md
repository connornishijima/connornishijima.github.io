# **Analog Audio Without A DAC (2016)**

#### If your PWM carrier is a higher frequency than the speaker's cone can physically reproduce, interesting things happen.

--------------------------------------------

<blurb>I designed Emotiscope as a powerful bridge between sight and sound, with a focus on imperceptable latency and minimalist design.</blurb>

## Part Highlights

### ESP32-S3 Microcontroller

- Dual-core 240 MHz (CPU and "GPU")
- Emotiscope Engine FW built on new ESP-IDF 5.x
- Uses Espressif's ESP-DSP library to perform SIMD operations on 32-bit floating point registers
- **GPU** / Core 0:
    - "Light Mode" Renderers (Shaders)
    - Simulated Phosphor Decay
    - Temporal Dithering
    - Incandescent LUT
    - RMT output to LEDs
    - 300-500 FPS
- **CPU** / Core 1: 
    - IO/touch reading
    - Audio acquisition
    - Goertzel (160 instances)
    - FFT
    - Tempo/phase estimation
    - Autocorrelation
    - WiFi
    - Websocket

## The "God Damn Fast Transform"

**Actually, "GDFT" is what I call a Goertzel-based Discrete Fourier Transform.**

Instead of an FFT where there's ***N / 2*** frequency bins spaced linearly on the scale, *I've opted to calculate 64 bins of my own choosing*, one at a time. This way, they can be allocated logarithmically to represent every note of the western musical scale between A2 (110Hz) and C8 (4186Hz). That's the upper 64 keys of a grand piano!
