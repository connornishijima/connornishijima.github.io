<bold>Below are a few of the products that I've designed and sold since 2016, utilizing a broad spectrum of manufacturing methods such as reflow soldering, 3D printing, laser cutting, PNP assembly, and more.</bold> <quiet>I also created the media for them using tools like Blender, Photoshop, and After Effects. I've been editing videos for twenty years, and have a well-rounded 3D animation skillset. Two of these ads are 100% CGI, rendered with the Cycles raytracing engine.</quiet><br><br>
