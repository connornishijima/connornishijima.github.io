**Embedded C/C++ Engineer**

I specialize in microcontrollers, high-refresh rate LED displays, and real-time audio analysis/synthesis.

My website - [the thing I *want* you to read](https://connor.nishiji.ma) instead of this README - is written in Markdown in the repository and automatically deployed as a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages, at my URL:
