**Embedded C/C++ Engineer**

I specialize in microcontrollers, high-refresh rate LED displays, and real-time audio analysis/synthesis.

My website - [the thing I *want* you to read](https://connor.nishiji.ma) instead of this README - is written in Markdown in the repository and automatically deployed as a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages, at my URL:

# [connor.nishiji.ma](https://connor.nishiji.ma)

The Jeykll theme my site is derived from is called [Just The Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs), and it's *fantastic*. I highly recommend it.

My other websites use it as well:
