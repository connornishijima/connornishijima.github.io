<blurb>I designed Lixie Displays because I could not afford Nixie Tubes. Development costed me much more than Nixie Tubes would have.</blurb>

## Make It Make Sense

**Doesn't developing and building your own fake Nixie Tubes cost more than Nixie Tubes?**

A: Yes

I've always been a fan of the Nixie Tube. Beautiful typography, endearing glow, and very clever technology. But when commercial production stopped in the 1990s, prices for surplus Nixie Tubes began to rise. Smaller tubes like the IN-16 are still only about $3.50/piece, but bigger and more desirable tubes like the IN-18 can run up to $45/piece. If you wanted to make a 6-digit clock, it can cost up to $270 just for the tubes!

That's not to mention the potential danger of having 170VDC around children and pets, the risk that they might "burn out" next week, and that they need special switching circuitry.
