## Hardware Design Overview

**Stunning when you need it, invisible when you don't**

With a show that’s reactive to notation, vibrato, tempo, and more, Emotiscope uses a powerful dual-core microcontroller to produce very unique and pleasant-to-look-at light shows which synchronize to your music without any perceptible latency.

It features a magic black diffuser covering 128 of the world’s smallest addressable LEDs, which are being refreshed at 300-500 FPS. This combination produces a beautiful, analog appearance with a high dynamic range and apparent spatial resolution.

## LEDs Pretending To Be More

**Your eyes can't see the tricks, just the results**

The RGB LEDs are 1.5mm apart and only 1mm in size. Even though these tiny LEDs already have a high pixel density, I also use subpixel rendering techniques that allow me to move (the apparent position of) dots on the screen less than 0.1mm at a time. The effect gives the illusion of a display with a spatial resolution >250 DPI.

Important to the illusion was the use of per-LED Temporal Dithering. These WS2812B-compatible LEDs only have 8-bits per color channel, which leads to awful banding artifacts at low brightnesses. However, they can be updated 500 times a second, which is much faster than your eyes can make out. By dithering the 8-bit color channels of each LED every few frames, your eyes are tricked into seeing a color depth of approximately 11-bits per channel. That's 2048 brightness levels instead of just 256, which leads to darker possible colors and better gradients at low brightnesess.

![TEMPORAL DITHERING](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connornishijima/connornishijima.github.io/main/img/emotiscope_dithering.jpg?raw=true)

This is a photo demonstrating the temporal dithering in action. By taking a photo while flinging my phone through the air, I've effectively used the Y-axis of this photo to show the passage of time. When seen normally with your eyes, this appears as a smooth rainbow gradient from red to blue at 1% brightness, with no banding. You can see here how Emotiscope is preserves color at low brightness with its limited LEDs.

Hardware brag: You're seeing entire rendered + dithered frames drawn by the second ESP32-S3 core (and then transferred to the display) in about the same time my keyboard LEDs take to do a single PWM pulse.

---------------------------------------------------

## Reversible Panels

**A logo you can hide!**

Beneath the display is a wooden panel of either Walnut or Bamboo, with the Emotiscope logo in the center. Both the wooden panel and the diffuser are reversible: The wood can be reversed to hide the logo, and the diffuser has either a matte side which is fingerprint resistant, or a classy gloss side with slightly higher contrast.

--------------------------------------------------

## 3D Printed Components

**Smooth, glittery, strong**

The plastic parts such as the feet and USB port cover are manufactured in-house with a Prusa Mini+ printer, in Galaxy Black PLA filament. They're designed to print quickly and without supports. I use a smooth print bed so that the faces of Emotiscope's feet are smooth to the touch.

--------------------------------------------------

## A Cushion Of Cork

**Thank me later**

Beneath Emotiscope's feet are laser-cut cork pads, which protect furniture from damage and provide a good grip on surfaces.

------------------------------------------------

## The Remote Control

**An app built by a hardware designer to be fun, responive, and ergonomic.**

You don’t need an account, there’s no ads, there’s no subscription. You can save it to your homescreen via the browser’s menu and it’ll get an icon just like a “real” app. Low-latency communication happens over a WS connection, while the underlying HTML/JS is stored and served from Emotiscope's filesystem.

## The "God Damn Fast Transform"

**Actually, "GDFT" is what I call a Goertzel-based Discrete Fourier Transform.**

<iframe class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FeMDX4kWn0s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Instead of an FFT where there's ***N / 2*** frequency bins spaced linearly on the scale, *I've opted to calculate 64 bins of my own choosing*, one at a time. This way, they can be allocated logarithmically to represent every note of the western musical scale between A2 (110Hz) and C8 (4186Hz). That's the upper 64 keys of a grand piano!

I used the Goertzel algorithm to quickly calculate each bin sequentially. This allows me to set custom window lengths (block sizes) for every bin to best balance them betweem time/frequency resolution and performance. Since Emotiscope is not a measurement tool, I was able to find compromises to the DSP code for the sake of speed without sacrificing the final look.

```c
float calculate_magnitude_of_bin(uint16_t bin_number) {
    float magnitude;
    float magnitude_squared;
    float normalized_magnitude;

    float q1 = 0;
    float q2 = 0;
    float window_pos = 0.0;

    // blocksize*2 for downsampling
    const uint16_t block_size = frequencies_musical[bin_number].block_size << 1;
    const float coeff = frequencies_musical[bin_number].coeff;
    const float window_step = frequencies_musical[bin_number].window_step;

    float* sample_ptr = &sample_history[(SAMPLE_HISTORY_LENGTH - 1) - block_size];

    for ( uint16_t i = 0; i < block_size; i++ ) {
        float windowed_sample = sample_ptr[i] * window_lookup[(uint32_t)window_pos];

        // Perform Goertzel step
        float q0 = coeff * q1 - q2 + windowed_sample;
        q2 = q1;
        q1 = q0;

        window_pos += window_step;
    }

    // Calculate magnitude, no phase
    magnitude_squared = (q1 * q1) + (q2 * q2) - q1 * q2 * coeff;
    magnitude = sqrtf(magnitude_squared);
    normalized_magnitude = magnitude_squared / (block_size / 2.0);

    return normalized_magnitude;
}
```

By having varying window lengths per bin, the highest notes can be detected with minimal sample data, and the lowest notes can still have good frequency-domain resolution with minimal latency.

Also employed is a lookup table to a Gaussian window. The index into this table is a floating point number incremented by "window_step", another non-integer. This allows for nearest-neighbor interpolation of the 4096-sample-long LUT at crazy speeds.

```c
void init_window_lookup() {
    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < 2048; i++) {
        // Gaussian window
        float sigma = 0.8;
        float n_minus_halfN = i - 2048 / 2;
        float gaussian_weighing_factor = exp(-0.5 * pow((n_minus_halfN / (sigma * 2048 / 2)), 2));
        float weighing_factor = gaussian_weighing_factor;

        window_lookup[i] = weighing_factor;
        window_lookup[4095 - i] = weighing_factor; // Mirror the value for the second half
    }
}
```
